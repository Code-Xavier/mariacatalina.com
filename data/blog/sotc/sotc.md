### Introduction:

Normal. It's a word Asher Hexun has never known the meaning of. He's never in the same place for long, and he's never met his mom. Not to mention he has weird markings all over his body- He has no clue what they mean and his dad won't tell him either. All he knows is that he is no normal. All these are mysteries that haunt him, until his life changes forever on his 15th birthday...
